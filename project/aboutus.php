							While we were conducting our research in Indonesia, we have found that there was not one distinct place that everyone would go to once they thought of churros and chocolate. </br>
							Right there and then, we found a proposition for Indonesia's market for their own personal Chocolateria. </br>
							All recipes originated from Spain. We also have mouth-watering desserts, from tarts to pralines, and not to mention our long list of rich chocolate drinks to quench your thirst. </br></br></br>
						
						<center><h2>Our Main Product</h2></center>
							The word Churreria is derived from the Spanish word "churro". </br>
							Churro itself is sometimes referred to as Spanish doughnuts, fried dough pastry-based snack that originated from Spain. </br>
							For a long time, churro has been popular in many countries, such as Australia. </br>
							The Spanish usually have it every morning as their breakfast, served with and dipped in chocolate.</br>
							However, with the spread of mixed culture around the world, churro has become irresistible for morning, afternoon, or night.</br> 
							It may also be dipped in other mouth-watering sauces, such as caramel. </p>
